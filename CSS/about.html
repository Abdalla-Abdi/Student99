                        <p class="table-warning"> An accountant is a person who keeps or inspects financial records. They're numbers people who excel at organization and detail-oriented work. Since they deal with money – sometimes significant amounts of it – accountants must also possess a high degree of integrity. And because they're constantly interacting with clients, accountants should be effective communicators. </p>
                        <p class="table-danger">As an accountant you will be responsible for preparing accounts, budgeting and managing financial information. You could also be advising and helping clients, whether that’s individuals or international companies, on financial situations. Accountants core responsibilities are typically to prepare and examine financial records, assuring information is up to date and accurate. However, you could specialise in particular areas such as forensic accounting or taxation or focus on more specific areas of a company's financial department.</p>
